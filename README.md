# Supervised-Learning-Project
This was a partnered project in Supervised Learning that was part of a Machine Learning course. The dataset that was being analyzed in this project related to the COVID-19
pandemic. In this project, we used Elastic Net Regression in order to predict the number of deaths per day on a state and national level. 
In addition, a Neural Network approach to binary classification was used to determine whether the 7-day average number of new cases in the US would increase or decrease in the 
next week based on the current week's daily new case numbers. The code for implementing the different machine learning techniques was done from scratch, and so no libraries
for performing these techniques was used. After our analysis, we saw that our regression and classification approaches both had an appreciable ability to predict the number of deaths in the future or classify whether the 7-day average number of cases would go up or down.
